Description: MOSAIC is a package for inferring ancestry segments and characterizing admixture events from dense genotype data. 
             Admixture involves a number of genetically differentiated groups coming together; MOSAIC jointly infers the demographic 
	     history of the samples and properties of the admixing groups. The algorithm employs nested hidden Markov models to obtain 
	     highly accurate ancestry estimation along the genome for each admixed individual. It does not require any prior knowledge 
	     of the relationship between sub-groups of donor reference haplotypes and the unseen mixing ancestral populations which 
	     MOSAIC infers terms of conditional "copying probabilities".
