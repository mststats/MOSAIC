*) remove --known TRUE usage and replace with example vector format --pops; don't use random examples either
simulated: --pops and length(pops)=A => use all others as panels
simulated: --pops and length(pops)>A => use supplied panels but must have length(pops)>=2*A
real: --pops first is target and rest are panels and length(panels)>=A

*) help file for run_mosaic only; re-use README.txt
*) shapeit input
*) don't grab all memory by default on a cluster: see Busby email.
