*) help file for run_mosaic only; re-use README.txt
*) shapeit inputs OR a conversion tool packaged with MOSAIC
*) add citation when MOSAIC is called (once accepted).
*) don't grab all memory by default on a cluster: see Busby email.
*) pass indices of individuals to MOSAIC rather than -n and -i
*) remove or reduce gfbs memory footprint
*) chromosomes greater than 22. Can replicate with copying #22 to fake #23
*) rates:
	*) if position of first rate is less than first SNP get error
	*) rates assumed linear between SNP loci; can do better (line 113 of read_panels.R)

*) Fst and Mu map plots?
