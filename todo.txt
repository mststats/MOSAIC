*) shapeit inputs OR a conversion tool packaged with MOSAIC
*) parallelise compressed_grid.cpp?
*) read in one SNP at a time for all individuals to reduce memory usage and speed up gridding
*) don't grab all memory by default on a cluster: see Busby email.
	*) remove or reduce gfbs memory footprint
*) pass indices of individuals to MOSAIC rather than -n and -i
*) Fst and Mu map plots?
