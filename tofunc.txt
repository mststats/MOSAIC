??? Perhaps not the below to avoid creating copies of large objects
could merge into single file to create single function for R-package
setup.R
localanc.R
phase_hunt.R (flips)
phase_mcmc.R (flips)
run.R # could leave as a run file or create a text file for this

Run all functions through cmpfun to check to missing objects
and check setup.R for single calls to all before moving into mosaicpackage
check for functions that take no arguments i.e. grep "()", *.R
